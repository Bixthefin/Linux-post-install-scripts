# Linux Post-Install Scripts
These scripts help with post-installation on Linux systems. Currently, they support only Debian-based distributions, such as Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, and others.

The scripts install the following applications:
Firefox, Steam, Discord, Prism Launcher, VLC, GNOME Tweaks, and Neofetch.

There are plans to add more applications as well as support for additional distributions in the future.
